# Idler

To keep away low-threat individuals (e.g. kids) from messing around your computer, it is best to lock your computer.
However, there are times when you want to leave some processes working in the background, thus you may want a way to lock your computer while preventing your computer from putting into sleep. This repository provides a few ways for you to let your computer idle and process whatever you want in the background.

## Getting Started

Download or copy desired scripts and execute them. Some may require admin/root privileges to function properly.
